The algorithm was developed by Andrew D. Booth and published for the first time in an article in \emph{The Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics} in 1951 \cite{Booth1951Signed}.
The algorithm was developed in a time where calculators were faster doing shift operations than sums.\par
