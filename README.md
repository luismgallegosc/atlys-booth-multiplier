# Booth multiplier implementation

Example project for a 4x4-bit Booth multiplier implementation using an [Atlys Spartan-6 FPGA Trainer Board](http://store.digilentinc.com/atlys-spartan-6-fpga-trainer-board-limited-time-see-nexys-video/).

**Note:** As of this writing, the board is listed as a legacy product and with limited production.

The algorithm was developed by Andrew D. Booth and published for the first time in an [article](https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmam/4.2.236 "A signed binary multiplication technique") in *[The Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics](http://qjmam.oxfordjournals.org/)* in 1951.
The algorithm was developed in a time where calculators were faster doing shift operations than sums.

More details on the algorithm can be found in the documentation.

A short video showing the multiplier working can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSdaQeM46E "4x4 booth multiplier").
